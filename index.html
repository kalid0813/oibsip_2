            <h2>Biograph</h2>
            <p>Mahatma Gandhi was the preeminent leader of India's independence movement against British colonial rule.
            Born in Porbandar, India, he studied law in London and practiced in South Africa, where he developed his philosophy of
            nonviolent resistance. Returning to India in 1915, he led peaceful protests and civil disobedience campaigns, including
            the famous Salt March. His principles of Ahimsa (nonviolence) and Satyagraha (truth force) inspired movements for civil
            rights and freedom worldwide. Gandhi's leadership led to India's independence in 1947. Tragically, he was assassinated
            in 1948, but his legacy endures as a symbol of peace, justice, and the power of nonviolent activism.</p>
